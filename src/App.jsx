Guidelines for the two questions:
- Ground them in this department's actual weakest areas and what staff wrote above — not generic management advice.
- Calibrate the tone to the overall status. For a Concern department, the questions should help the leader confront a real, significant gap honestly. For Watch, help them investigate something mixed or emerging before it worsens. For Healthy, help them protect and build on a strength while staying curious about blind spots.
- Each question should prompt the leader to think about HOW they will find this information out about their team — what conversations to have, what to observe, who to ask — rather than assuming they already know the answer.
- Make them open, non-defensive, and genuinely thought-provoking. Avoid yes/no questions. Avoid jargon.
- Write them so a busy ministry leader would pause and actually think.
